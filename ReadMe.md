# Balloon Popping

## Description

This project includes a balloon popping game where computers and mobile devices work simultaneously.

## Usage

After running the project:

To start the game, a user on a Windows device must initiate the project:
  - Click the 'start' button on the interface to begin the game.
  - Once the game starts, a random user among those participating in the project receives a question.

For users initiating the project on a mobile device:
  - The user who receives a question on their device must answer it within a specified time.
  - When the correct answer is given, the turn passes to a different user.
  - The balloon continues to inflate until a correct answer is provided.
  - If a user fails to give the correct answer within a certain time, the turn moves to a different user.
  - These processes continue until the balloon pops.
  - When the balloon pops, the user in turn loses the game.
